  At 2013, CMA launched its interactive gallery <a href="http://www.clevelandart.org/gallery-one" target="_blank">Gallery One</a>. It soon became the talk in the whole museum world. FRED A. BERNSTEIN wrote in an article for New York Times:
  <br>

  <blockquote>......He may be right. “In the museum world, everyone’s watching Cleveland right now,” said Erin Coburn, a museum consultant who has worked at both the J. Paul Getty Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Though other museums have experimented with interactive technology, the extent of Cleveland’s program is unprecedented, she said. “They’ve put a lot out there for other museums to learn from.”......</blockquote><cite>New York Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/arts/artsspecial/at-cleveland-museum-of-art-the-ipad-enhances.html">"Technology That Serves to Enhance, Not Distract"</a>, March 20, 2013</cite>

3 years after the first launch, the museum is looking for a redesign and an upgrade for its star gallery. Potion was commissioned for the design, development and installation for the 2nd generation of Gallery One.
