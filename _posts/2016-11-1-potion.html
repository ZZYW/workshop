<h3>About Potion</h3>

<p>Potion Design is a private interactive design firm located in New York City. It was founded in 2005 by Jared Schiffman and Phillip Tiongson, who had previously studied together at the MIT Media Lab. The firm's specialty is interactive kiosks, especially flat surfaces that respond to human input through a combination of light displays and overhead video cameras.</p>

<p>Museums for which Potion Design has created installations include the National World War I Museum in Kansas City, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City, the Smithsonian Institution's National Building Museum and National Museum of American History in Washington, D.C., and the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago.</p>

<h3>About the project</h3>

<p>From April 2016, I started working for Potion as their first Intearction Designer. During my time at Potion, one of the projects I led was the design for its new website (<a href="http://potiondesign.com" target="_blank">potiondesign.com</a>)who was lauched at November, 2016. </p>

<p>The whole design and development took about 4 months, starting from the summer. The UX and information architecture took 1/3 of the time. I also participated the site building responsible for the front-end programming.</p>
